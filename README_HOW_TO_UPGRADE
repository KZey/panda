# Profiles

The output encoding profiles now must include the ffmpeg command to be run. Previously these were hardcoded into Panda. To make profiles simpler, Panda will now require you to put the encoding details such as bitrate into the ffmpeg command.

The only thing Panda will interpret is the resolution. By default Panda will add black bar letter boxing (both vertical and horizontal) to videos which don't match the output resolution.

We are working to provide a separate set of tools which will assist with the creation and management of encoding profiles.

See the README for example profiles.

# Notifications

TODO: Implement this!
 
Instead of setting a global notification callback url (the address which Panda sends a message to when a video has been encoded), you will need to provide the url in the POST request when you create a new video using the API.

Changing this means that you can now easily use and test Panda with multiple applications.

# Migrating to the new SimpleDB schema

TODO: Write scripts and test the hell out of it

Changes
* simple_record uses a different number storage method.
* Video and Encoding are now separate domains.
* Rename filenames to extnames

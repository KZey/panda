* [done in new-bamboo/simple_record fork] Rename update and created to have _at in simple record
* Test post /videos
* API signatures + blog post on how to do it
* SimpleDB pagination for index get requests
* Raise RecordNotFound when using SimpleDB (right now we just return nil)
* Test ajax responses including errors
* Non-flash file upload. Write js (extract stuff from jquery.form.js) which submits file in an iframe and processes response.
* Use nginx with file upload plugin so ruby doesn't touch any video data

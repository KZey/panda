* [done in new-bamboo/simple_record fork] Rename update and created to have _at in simple record
* [done] Test post /videos
* API signatures + blog post on how to do it
* SimpleDB pagination for index get requests
* Raise RecordNotFound when using SimpleDB (right now we just return nil)
* Non-flash file upload. Write js (extract stuff from jquery.form.js) which submits file in an iframe and processes response.
* Use nginx with file upload plugin so ruby doesn't touch any video data: e.g. http://www.motionstandingstill.com/nginx-upload-awesomeness/2008-08-13/
* Split api auth into a separate gem
* Move git clone git://github.com/dctanner/rvideo.git to newbamboo account
